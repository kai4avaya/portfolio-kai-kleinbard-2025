## About Me

Hello, I'm **Kai Kleinbard** - software developer, AI specialist, and educator.

I'm a computer and data scientist who loves to use deep learning and large language models to make things that are easy to use and friendly. I started **Somatikai**, a place where I explore how AI and body awareness work together. I also run **bodyLITERATE**, an organization that helps people who learn differently. And I created **The Institute for Playful Beings and PlayLab**, where I play with different ways of being and learning.

I have a **Masters Degree from UPenn**, where I studied how to make digital tools more accessible for neuro-diverse learners. At Penn I assisted in research and teaching graduate algorithms and computational mathematics. **I love math!**

When I'm not coding or designing algorithms, I work with families at conflict with schools, supporting neurodivergent learners to obtain the supports they need. I learned **Motivational Interviewing**, a kind of therapy, from William R Miller, who invented it. Besides all that, I'm still a dancer and a martial artist at heart.

## Projects and Current Research

I am curious about how we can **somatize the digital experience**, which involves bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds to create a more immersive and embodied interaction with technology. In this context, embodied means grounding the digital experience in bodily sensations and physical presence, allowing users to engage with technology in a more natural and intuitive way.

I hope to use artificial intelligence to create more accessible and equitable education experiences for neurodivergent students. My goal is to make AI a part of education that helps all students, especially those who learn differently, feel included and supported. I hope that by using AI in education, we can bring people together and create a kinder digital world where everyone can learn and grow.

Beyond this, I also believe we need to create systems that are accountable to privacy needs and fully transparent.

![Kai Kleinbard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kai4avaya/portfolio-kai-kleinbard-2025/master/images/kai-kleinbard-edtech.png)

I‚Äôve always been drawn to both tech and education. I kicked off my academic journey researching ML systems at the University of Pennsylvania, dove into computer-human interaction and design at Harvard, and wrapped things up with an analytics degree from Georgia Tech.

Right now, I‚Äôm having a blast building generative art systems and diving into that sweet spot where art, movement, AI, and learning collide. My driving force is crafting more intuitive, equitable learning experiences‚Äîusing technology to blur the line between the digital and the physical.
